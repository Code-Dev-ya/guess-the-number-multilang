# Guess the Number Game (C & Python)

An interactive console-based Guess the Number game implemented in **C** and later **ported to Python** to demonstrate strong fundamentals and language-independent problem solving.

## Features

- **Multiple Difficulty Modes**
  - Easy (8 attempts)
  - Medium (5 attempts)
  - Hard (3 attempts)

- **Endless Mode**
  - Unlimited rounds
  - Tracks attempts per round
  - Tracks total attempts
  - Displays detailed session summary on exit

- **Case-insensitive input handling**
- Clean control flow and reusable logic

## What I Learned

This project helped me understand and implement:

- Session-level vs round-level state management
- Nested loop control flow
- Arrays / lists for storing runtime history
- Function abstraction to remove duplicate logic
- Proper random number generation usage
- Translating the same system from **C to Python**

The Python version was built after the C version, using the same logical structure.
